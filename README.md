Diabetes Diagnosis Using Machine Learning

Overview
This project applies unsupervised (K-Means Clustering) and supervised (Decision Tree & Random Forest) machine learning models to diagnose diabetes using the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset. The goal is to compare model performance and analyze the important features in diabetes prediction.

Dataset
•	The PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
•	It consists of 768 observations with 8 medical predictor variables (such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, and age) and 1 target variable (diabetes outcome: 0 = No, 1 = Yes).
Algorithms Used
✅ K-Means Clustering – Used for unsupervised analysis to explore natural data groupings. ✅ Decision Tree – A supervised learning model for classification. ✅ Random Forest – An ensemble method to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Project Goals
✔ Compare different ML models for diabetes diagnosis. ✔ Understand feature importance in diabetes prediction. ✔ Optimize model performance using hyperparameter tuning. ✔ Visualize model performance using various evaluation metrics.

Usage
1.	Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2.	Apply feature scaling and data preprocessing.
3.	Train models (K-Means, Decision Tree, Random Forest) and evaluate their performance.
4.	Analyze feature importance and fine-tune hyperparameters.
5.	Interpret results and visualize findings.

Results & Evaluation
•	K-Means Clustering helped identify hidden patterns in data.
•	Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy compared to Decision Tree.
•	Feature importance analysis showed glucose level and BMI were the most significant factors in diabetes prediction.
